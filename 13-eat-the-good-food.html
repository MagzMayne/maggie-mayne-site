        <h1>🍎 Eat the Good Food</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Food is one of my love languages</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"What we eat becomes who we are - cell by cell, moment by moment. It's the foundation of vitality, resilience, and radiant energy."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Nutrition plays a huge, pivotal role in supporting your body's natural healing abilities. I believe that food is one of my love languages. It's how I care, how I create, and how I connect.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to gardening, I have a deep passion for preparing intentional meals. There is something sacred about turning raw, vibrant ingredients into nourishment. Every step - chopping, simmering, seasoning - becomes a ritual of love and presence.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Begin Where You Are</h2>
        
        <p>The best thing you can do is to begin where you are. Focus on cooking at home when you can. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods that provide essential nutrients for optimal health.</p>
        
        <div class="food-list">
            <p>Choose foods as close to their natural state as possible</p>
            <p>Fresh fruits and vegetables in abundance</p>
            <p>Whole grains that nourish and sustain</p>
            <p>Plant-based fats like avocado, olive oil, nuts</p>
            <p>Clean sources of protein</p>
            <p>Hydration throughout the day</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Try to limit processed foods, excessive sugar, and stimulants like caffeine, which can disrupt your mood, sleep, and internal rhythm. When we flood the body with refined ingredients and synthetic additives, it's not just our cells that suffer - it's our spirit, too.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Here's the MAGIC</h2>
        
        <p>Eating well isn't just about restriction or discipline - it's about devotion. It's about choosing foods that make you feel alive, vibrant, and supported. It's about tapping into your own intuitive wisdom and letting your body lead the way.</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"Every bite is an opportunity to love yourself more. Every meal is a chance to come home."</div>

        <h2>Growing Your Own Food</h2>
        
        <p>Growing your own food - whether it's a full backyard garden or a few herbs on a windowsill - can be a deeply empowering and healing act. Gardening reconnects you to the Earth, to cycles of growth, to patience and care.</p>
        
        <p>There's something extraordinary about harvesting your own tomatoes, mint, or greens and knowing that you helped bring them into being. It is nourishment on every level - physical, emotional, and spiritual.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"Historically, we lived in communities where food was grown, harvested, shared, and preserved. We were self-sustaining, not because it was trendy, but because it was necessary - and it was good."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Returning to that rhythm, even in small ways, can help ground you in your body and connect you to the deeper wisdom of the Earth.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2 id="nourish">🔥 Nourish Your MAGIC</h2>
        
        <p>Eating REAL food is the key to losing weight, speeding up your metabolism, and improving your overall health. This approach supports nervous system regulation, strength building, and detoxing. Food provides the building blocks of your cells - every single one of them.</p>
        
        <p>From now on, "D.I.E.T." will mean <strong>"DID I EAT TODAY."</strong></p>
        
        <p>Now you're going to get to eat a lot - at least three full meals and multiple snacks a day. No calorie counting, no weird fad foods, and no deprivation. Instead, you rotate what you eat throughout each week according to a simple and proven plan that retrains your sluggish, broken-down metabolism, turning it into a fat-burning furnace!</p>
        
        <div style="background: rgba(255,215,0,0.1); padding:1.5rem; border-radius:12px; margin:2rem 0; border:1px solid rgba(255,215,0,0.3);">
            <h3 style="color:#FFD700; font-family:'Cinzel',serif; margin-bottom:1rem; text-align:center;">🔥 The Three Phases</h3>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom:1.5rem; padding-bottom:1rem; border-bottom:1px solid rgba(255,215,0,0.2);">
                <p style="color:#90EE90; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Phase 1: Unwind Stress</p>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0;">High-glycemic fruit + moderate protein + low-fat + vigorous cardio. This phase calms the adrenals and reduces cortisol.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom:1.5rem; padding-bottom:1rem; border-bottom:1px solid rgba(255,215,0,0.2);">
                <p style="color:#FF69B4; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Phase 2: Unlock Fat Stores</p>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0;">Very high-protein + high-vegetable + low-carbohydrate + low-fat + strength training. This phase builds muscle and unlocks stored fat.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p style="color:#87CEEB; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Phase 3: Unleash The Burn</p>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0;">High healthy-fat + moderate carbohydrate + moderate protein + low-glycemic fruit + stress-reducing activity. This phase ignites your metabolism.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>This approach to eating is designed to look and feel better from eating food - not from deprivation. Best part? You can find recipes broken down by phase to make it simple and sustainable.</p>

        <h2>Food as Medicine</h2>
        
        <p>Nutrition is more than just fueling the body - it is a cornerstone of clarity, vitality, and energetic alignment. The foods we consume affect everything: our physical health, mental function, emotional balance, hormonal cycles, and spiritual connection.</p>
        
        <div class="practice-box">
            <h3>🍎 Nutrition Protocol</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;"><strong>Frequency:</strong> Every Meal</p>
