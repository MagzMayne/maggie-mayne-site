        <h1>🪞 The Mirror, The Mess & The Magic</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Truth from the Ones Who've Walked Through Fire</p>

        <p>Facts are sometimes the most spiritual-looking person in the room isn't the one holding the deepest truth. Usually the person who looks like the mess - the one still covered in ash from their own transformation - is the one carrying the most MAGIC.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>The real mirror. The one who has walked through fire and returned not just with ashes, but with answers.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That has been my lived experience. I've been the one who looked "too much" or "not enough." The one crying on the bathroom floor. The one glowing and thriving. The one falling apart while still holding space for others.</p>

        <h2>When People Pull Away</h2>

        <p>I've had clients who came to me for years - years - pull away the moment I started glowing, or struggling. As soon as I started rising, or just needed a minute and was no longer at their beck and call - embodying the things I had always taught, they disappeared.</p>

        <p>Or worse - they echoed my words back at me... but not with love. With shade. With smugness. As if my truth was only safe when it was serving them.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The same people who once soaked up my MAGIC began pretending they created it. I know I am not alone in this, because I've heard this more than once.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That stung. Bad. It sucks. It's disorienting when people you poured into start pretending they never drank from your cup.</p>

        <p>Here's the truth: they were never yours to keep. They were assignments. Lessons. Sometimes you're the teacher. Sometimes you're the mirror. Sometimes you're both - and it costs you something anyway.</p>

        <h2>Boundaries Are Not a Bypass</h2>

        <p>Here's what we must acknowledge: boundaries are not a bypass. They're not an excuse to cut people off every time we get triggered. Sometimes the people who irritate us the most are the ones reflecting back what we still need to heal.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>In this world of "choose yourself" and "protect your peace," it's easy to forget that healing also requires humility. That boundaries must be paired with self-awareness. That our triggers are teachers too.</p>
        </div>

        <p>There's a popular narrative that if someone triggers you, you should just cut them off. But the truth is more nuanced than that. People are mirrors. Relationships are assignments. True discernment is the tool that helps you tell the difference between what's toxic and what's trying to teach you.</p>

        <p>Sometimes your discomfort is wisdom. Sometimes it's projection. Usually, it's both.</p>

        <h2>The Most Important Tests</h2>

        <p>The most important spiritual tests might just come from the lady in front of you at the DMV, the driver that just cut you off in traffic or the client who has your same patterns and pushes all your same buttons.</p>

        <p>I've learned more from "regular people" than I ever did from some of my supposed spiritual idols. In fact, I've met many of those idols. Honestly? Some were everything I hoped. Others were hollow behind the glow.</p>

        <h2>Truth Has a Frequency</h2>

        <p>This work, this life, this path of truth - it's not a popularity contest. It's a pilgrimage.</p>

        <p>Sometimes when you're walking that path, you send out a message - a transmission - and you wait... No replies. No "likes", no applause. Just energetic stillness. It can make you question everything.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>But that message? That truth? It landed. Even if no one said so. The ones who needed it received it. The ones who weren't ready just scrolled past. Both are okay.</p>
        </div>

        <p>When you speak at the actual frequency of transformation, people don't always know how to respond. It hits something ancient. Something sacred. Something they're not quite ready to face. So they stay quiet. Or they leave. Or they pretend they never heard it.</p>

        <div class="poetry">
            We don't write for claps. We write for awakening.<br>
            We don't rise for validation. We rise for liberation.<br><br>
            We don't always get met right away - but eventually, the ones who are meant to walk with us will find us.
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #FFD700; margin-top: 2rem;">Truth has a frequency. The ones who can hear it? They're already on their way.</p>
