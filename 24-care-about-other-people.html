        <h1>❤️ Care About Other People</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Because We Are Not Islands</p>

        <p>Life is a funny thing. We often spend so much time trying to figure out how to take care of ourselves - how to protect our energy, how to preserve our peace, how to set boundaries - that sometimes we forget one of the most important truths of the human experience:</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>We are not islands. We are humans, wired for connection, for love, for community.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Our actions don't exist in a vacuum. The way we show up for others is just as important as the way we show up for ourselves.</p>

        <p>I get it. It's hard. Sometimes we feel like we're giving so much, and all we get in return is judgment, criticism, or indifference. Just because you're on a healing journey doesn't mean you stop caring. In fact, the more you care for others, the more you strengthen the bonds that hold us together.</p>

        <h2>The Gift of Truly Listening</h2>

        <p>When you care, you give them space to care for you too. Listening - truly listening - is one of the greatest gifts you can give. It's not just about hearing the words; it's about feeling the emotions behind them, recognizing the struggles, the pain, and the vulnerability that comes with sharing one's heart.</p>

        <h2>The Nuance of Family</h2>

        <p>This brings me to something important, especially when we are navigating complicated family dynamics: life is short. People are not perfect. And healing is rarely linear.</p>

        <p>Family, man, it's a tough one. There's a weird narrative going around these days, especially with younger generations, that if someone is "toxic" or doesn't fit into your picture of peace, you should just cut them off. Go no-contact. Block and delete.</p>

        <p>While boundaries are essential - necessary, even - there's a difference between drawing a line to protect your peace and cutting people off out of convenience, projection, or avoidance.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>This is the line that gets blurry. If you truly love someone, if they are family - whether by blood or by choice - cutting them off completely, without understanding or even a chance to heal and hear them, can leave wounds that echo through generations.</p>
        </div>

        <p>It's tough to shake. Love and grace are the antidotes to most hurts. You're doing the hard work for a reason - to heal yourself, your lineage, your family - and that often means showing up for people who haven't quite completed their own healing yet.</p>

        <h2>The Ache of Estrangement</h2>

        <p>Estrangement hurts in a way most people can't name. It's not loud. It's not dramatic. It's not always marked by a final fight or a slammed door. Sometimes it's just a slow fade... a missed birthday... a silence that stretches too long. Like waiting for someone to come home who stopped calling it home a long time ago.</p>

        <div class="poetry">
            Yet - you still love them. You still show up. Even if it's just in spirit. Even if it's just in the way you keep their baby photos on your fridge - the way you never stop praying for their peace.
        </div>

        <p>Here's something people don't say enough: It's okay to love someone who isn't loving you well. It doesn't make you weak. It doesn't make you codependent. It makes you a human being with a heart. A heart that remembers the good. A heart that holds out hope. A heart that knows people are more than their hardest seasons.</p>

        <h2>Boundaries AND Love</h2>

        <p>You also have every right to have boundaries around your own pain. To say, "I love you, but I can't keep shrinking myself to be what you need me to be." To say, "I'm here when you're ready - but not at the cost of my own sanity."</p>

        <p>This is where it gets complex, isn't it? Because you're not trying to control them. You're not trying to guilt them. You just want the truth to be seen. The WHOLE truth. You want love to win. Not the Instagram version of love. But the kind that sits through hard conversations. The kind that forgives. The kind that lasts.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>The Maggie Way holds space for all of it. The healing. The ache. The boundaries. The glow-ups. The forgiveness. The new beginnings. The sacred no's. The yeses that change everything.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Love is Still Allowed</h2>

        <p>Grief is still valid. Just because someone left doesn't mean they were right. If you're the one left behind, I want you to hear this:</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>You are not broken. You are not less spiritual. You are not "unhealed" just because someone made you the villain in a story they never let you tell.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Maybe they needed distance. Maybe you needed grace. Maybe it's both. It's ALWAYS both.</p>

        <p>Maybe, just maybe... One day, they'll remember your love - and come home to it - Not to the house - but to the heart.</p>

        <p>Until then, hold the whole truth. With gentleness. With hope. With a little more softness than the world expects of you.</p>

        <h2>Your Affirmations</h2>

        <div class="poetry">
            You are not toxic just because someone said you were.<br>
            You are not wrong for wanting to be included.<br>
            You are allowed to have your story too.<br>
            You are allowed to speak your pain.<br>
            You are allowed to say: "I'm the one who stayed. I'm the one who healed. I'm the one who showed up even when it hurt."<br>
            You are allowed to miss them without betraying yourself.<br>
            You are allowed to hold love and sadness in the same breath.<br>
            You are allowed to keep living. Fully. Loudly. Softly. Honestly.
        </div>

        <p>Even if they're not ready to come home yet. You are the real thing. You're the one who loved through the fire. When the time comes - if it comes - you will still be here, not because you never left, but because you never stopped loving.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>That's not weakness. That's legacy. That, my love, is the heart of The Maggie Way.</p>
        </div>
