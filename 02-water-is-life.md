# The Maggie Way: Water is LIFE

*An excerpt from The Maggie Way: Holistic Healing*

Water surrounds every layer and level of our being, and YOU are mostly water.

**Water is LIFE.**

Proper hydration is essential for maintaining homeostasis, which is the body's ability to keep a stable internal environment despite any external changes.

## What Water Does For You

Water helps regulate your body temperature through sweating and respiration. When you're hot, sweating cools the body as the sweat evaporates.

Proper hydration helps maintain our blood volume, ensuring efficient circulation of oxygen and nutrients while helping to simultaneously remove waste products.

Water helps to dissolve and transport electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and calcium, which are essential for nerve signaling, muscle function, and pH balance.

Every cell in our bodies relies on water to function properly. It facilitates biochemical reactions, transports nutrients, and removes waste.

Hydration supports the kidneys in filtering our blood and excreting waste through urine and digestion, preventing toxin buildup.

Water helps cushion and lubricate joints, muscles, and organs, reducing friction and preventing damage.

## Beyond the Physical

Water keeps us physically strong, mentally sharp, emotionally balanced, and spiritually aligned.

Water teaches us to move gracefully with life's currents rather than resist them, and symbolizes our ability to trust and adapt.

Oceans, rivers, rain, and snow remind us of our sacred connection with the universe and the magical nature of water itself.

Water enhances our inherent connection to nature and the divine, enhances our own internal and natural rhythms of ebb and flow, and is a great unifier, in the sense that we can all agree on its significance and importance.

## The Emotional Connection

Water is linked to emotions and intuition in many spiritual traditions, helping us connect with our inner wisdom.

Water directly connects us to our emotions, helping us feel more stable and in flow with life.

Our tears can allow for a physical release of emotions. Drinking enough water helps us to be able to process complex emotions and assists us in clearing any and all stagnant energy.

Water is often associated with spiritual cleansing, from baptisms to ritual baths. It can wash away negative energy.

## The Consequences of Dehydration

Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, constipation, and sluggishness. Even very mild dehydration can cause brain fog, poor concentration, depression, and memory issues.

Over time, chronic and prolonged dehydration leads to a breakdown of our structural alignment and cellular function. Dehydration is a major cause of every and all symptoms of dis-ease.

If we are dehydrated, the lymphatic fluid in our tissues actually slows down, stops completely, or gets super thick and has a difficult time moving freely. This affects every system of our body, mind, emotions, and spirit.

**Lymphatic congestion can immediately cause:**
- Impaired and decreased immunity
- Bloating, swelling, or puffiness (especially in bellies, face, hands, and feet)
- Constipation
- Menstrual irregularities
- Sleep interruptions
- Low energy and unexplained fatigue
- Pain, headaches, joint pain, muscle stiffness
- Acne and clogged pores, dull and itchy skin
- Brain fog
- Weight gain

## The Practice

Drink every sip of water with intention and set an affirmation as you drink, like "This water nourishes my body and soul."

Take baths, use Epsom salts, herbs, crystals, and essential oils to energetically cleanse.

Spend time near water however and whenever you can. Whether it's the ocean, a river, or a simple fountain, water carries healing vibrations.

Listen to water sounds as much as possible. The sound of rain, waves, a babbling brook, or a stream can help calm your mind and bring you spiritual clarity.

## Important Notes

Truly hydrating and supporting the water element in your body isn't about just gulping down a whole bunch of water today.

**Don't do that.** It actually dilutes the electrolytes in your blood, and may overwhelm your kidneys.

You need to start increasing your water intake slowly, especially if you've been in a state of prolonged dehydration, as most people have.

True hydration is about getting the proper amount of water into your cells and deep into your organ tissues.

## The 90 Day Commitment

Go get yourself a new water bottle or a special cup and set an intention to recommit to your relationship with water over the next 90 days.

**If this is all you do, it will change your entire life.**

Adding in mineral rich herbal teas like peppermint, chamomile, nettle, lemon balm, raspberry leaf, and dandelion can also be very supportive.

The best way to infuse minerals into your water is to add the herbs to hot water and allow them to infuse for 12 hours or more. It's also very supportive to make a sun or moon tea.

Any time you can add in electrolytes or trace minerals that are not sugar filled is also very beneficial.

Eating lots of fresh produce and adding in some hydrating fruits and vegetables like pineapple, cantaloupe, watermelon, and cucumber can be a fun way to support hydration. Everything counts.
