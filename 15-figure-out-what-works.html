        <h1>✨ Figure Out What Works for YOU</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">then DO that</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"You are your own BEST healer. Sometimes we just need a witness."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.2rem; color:#DDA0DD; margin-bottom:2rem;">You are a soul, you have a body, and you are always at choice.</p>
        
        <p>The relationship between the soul and the body in the context of free will is deeply philosophical and spiritual, and has been explored for centuries. When we explore the nature of our own consciousness, our decision making capabilities as humans, and the balance between our purely physical existence and survival needs and the longing for spiritual significance that embraces our true essence, we move into magical realms.</p>
        
        <p>These are some of my favorite conversations to have. We don't really know, but the more we honor our own intuition and connect to our divine wisdom the more we inner-stand.</p>
        
        <p>I think that we have probably forgotten much more than we remember in most cases, and that is probably by design. If we knew now, we might miss the magic and lessons of this life experience.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Soul & Body</h2>
        
        <div class="soul-body">
            <div class="soul-box">
                <h3>✨ The Soul</h3>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">The core of our identity. Eternal, infinite, divine essence. The source of our free will.</p>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0;">The soul seeks peace, knowledge, wisdom, love, and connection. I like to think of the soul as our highest heart.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="body-box">
                <h3>💗 The Body</h3>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">The physical manifestation of our existence. Bound by natural laws. Biologically programmed.</p>
                <p style="font-size:0.95rem; margin-bottom:0;">The body craves comfort and often seeks instant gratification, pleasure, and security.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Free will acts as the bridge between the soul and body, allowing the soul to express itself in the physical realm. Free will enables us to rise above mere instinct and make choices that are in alignment with our deeper soul purpose or higher callings, if we so choose.</p>
        
        <p>The ideal state we can hope to achieve is balance in the sense that the body is not denied but also is not the master. When free will is used wisely, the body becomes a tool for the soul's purpose, allowing us to express love, create, heal, and experience life fully without being ruled by external forces or temporary desires.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Becoming Your Own Authority</h2>
        
        <p>When we are feeling grounded, centered and confident, and fully encompassing all of our precious life force energy and vitality, we are able to more consistently evaluate and observe our own physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies.</p>
        
        <p>When we cultivate these internal observation skills, we can more easily and readily identify what is working well and what may need more attention or support.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"At the end of the day, no one can tell you what to do. Even if they could, would you listen, or would you still want to try to figure it out for yourself?"</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Others can offer you advice, tools, wisdom, ideas, and support, or share what has worked for them or other people, but you truly have to figure out what works for you, and then do that.</p>
        
        <p>Let's be real, you are going to go ahead and do whatever you want to do anyway, right?</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"That's actually fantastic, because you are truly the absolute, ultimate, and utmost authority of you."</div>
        
        <p>There is no one else that knows you better from the inside out, more than you. You are also going to be the only one that is accountable to living your life within the consequences of whatever choices you choose to make.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Choose Your Own Adventure</h2>
        
        <p>When you are deciding what to do, where to go, or how you want to be, it helps to have an open mind, embrace change as a constant, embrace fluidity, and have a willingness to adapt. What worked for you last week may not suffice tomorrow, next month or next year.</p>
        
        <div class="truth-list">
            <p>Moving to a new place</p>
            <p>Shifting careers</p>
            <p>Learning meditation and breath work</p>
            <p>Taking nature walks</p>
            <p>Learning how to brew kombucha</p>
            <p>Cultivating a creative passion into a business</p>
            <p>Incorporating new spiritual traditions</p>
            <p>Whatever resonates with YOUR soul</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>There are so many ways to incorporate self care, to nourish your own self awareness and observation skills, and live a life of vibrant health and meaning. You set the bar.</p>
        
        <p>You get to decide your path, and you get to choose your own adventure. When it comes to every facet of your daily life, you are mostly at choice.</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"You truly have to figure out what works for you, and then do that."</div>
        
        <div class="footer">
