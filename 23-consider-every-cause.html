        <h1>🔥 Consider Every Cause</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Real healing asks us to witness all of it</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"When we begin to truly heal, it's not just about addressing the physical symptoms we're facing. Healing is so much more layered than that - it's a multidimensional journey that calls us into deeper awareness of ourselves."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Real healing asks us to pause and consider every cause - physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, ancestral, energetic, and environmental.</p>
        
        <p>It means looking at the complex interplay between the nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system - all of which are dancing to the rhythms of our thoughts, emotions, beliefs, relationships, traumas, and soul lessons. There is no one-size-fits-all, quick-fix magic pill. The deeper magic is in your willingness to witness all of it.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Body is a Messenger</h2>
        
        <p>Let's be real - sometimes a headache isn't just a headache. It could be dehydration, sure - but it could also be unprocessed grief, stuck emotions, repressed intuition, or an inner knowing trying to get your attention.</p>
        
        <p>The body is not a nuisance - it's a messenger. When we begin to listen to those messages instead of silencing them, we open the door to something powerful.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't about becoming obsessive or fearful - it's about becoming curious.</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"We ask, 'What is this really about?' Then we listen."</div>
        
        <div class="cause-list">
            <p>What's happening in our environment?</p>
            <p>What's happening in our relationships?</p>
            <p>How is our sleep? Our hydration?</p>
            <p>What's happening with our hormones?</p>
            <p>What's the state of our nervous system?</p>
            <p>What is our soul trying to tell us?</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>We zoom out. We get honest. We go deeper. This can lead us into the realm of uncomfortable - but that discomfort is often the gateway to profound transformation.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Truth About Boundaries</h2>
        
        <p>True healing doesn't ask you to pretend everything is fine. It asks you to tell the truth.</p>
        
        <p>Here's the truth: sometimes when you really start healing, people leave. Let me say that again for the ones in the back:</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"Sometimes when you set boundaries, people leave. That too... is a gift."</div>
        
        <p>Setting boundaries is NOT about cutting people off, being cold, or avoiding growth. Healthy boundaries are rooted in self-awareness, accountability, and a deep knowing of your own worth. They are not a hall pass to avoid self-reflection.</p>
        
        <p>There is a BIG difference between honoring your energetic needs and using "boundaries" as a cover story to avoid healing your own stuff.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"If you're setting boundaries but never asking, 'What's my part in this?' - then you're not doing the real work. You're just shifting the blame. Guess what? That's not The Maggie Way."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>People Are Mirrors</h2>
        
        <p>The Maggie Way is about balance. Boundaries and self-inquiry. Protection and reflection. Honoring your intuition and examining your projections. Choosing what's best for your nervous system and recognizing when someone is mirroring something you haven't yet healed.</p>
        
        <p>People are mirrors. Some of them will show you what still needs to be healed. Others will reflect your light. Some will do both. When you start changing, growing, and rising - it's natural that not everyone will stay on the ride. Let them go.</p>
        
        <p>Not everyone is meant to walk with you in every season.</p>
        
        <p>If you lose people because you told the truth, honored your capacity, or held a boundary with love - you didn't lose them. You found yourself.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Welcome Home</h2>
        
        <p>Healing in this way - considering every layer and every cause - brings us back to the power of integration. We aren't just patching holes or managing symptoms. We are tending to the root system. We are inviting in coherence between the physical, emotional, energetic, and spiritual layers of our being.</p>
        
        <p>When you commit to this kind of healing journey, you change your biology, your patterns, your relationships, and your life. You become whole again - not because you fixed what was broken, but because you remembered what was true.</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"You have always been whole. You just forgot. now... we remember. This is The Maggie Way. Welcome home."</div>
