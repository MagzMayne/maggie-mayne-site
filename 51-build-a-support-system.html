            <p class="blog-subtitle">You were never meant to walk this path all alone</p>
        </header>
        
        <article class="blog-content">
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>You are your own healer.</p>
                <p>Your own advocate.</p>
                <p>Your own home.</p>
                <p><strong>But you were never meant to walk this path all alone.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Healing is your responsibility, but support is your birthright.</p>

            <p>Cultivating a support system isn't something you do once and check off a list. It's a living, breathing practice. It evolves with you. The people who walk with you today may shift tomorrow. And that's okay. What matters is that you stay open to receiving, while also staying rooted in the truth that no one is coming to save you.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"It is your job to take care of you. Let that truth empower you, not isolate you."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">✨ The Role of Witness</h2>

            <p>Your support system is not there to rescue you. They are there to witness you. To mirror your growth. To remind you of your light when you temporarily forget.</p>

            <p>Seek those who will sit with you, not fix you. Those who celebrate your joy and hold space for your grief. Those who challenge you lovingly and let you evolve without trying to pull you back into old versions of yourself.</p>

            <p>Surround yourself with people who are also doing the work. People who speak your language, even when it's just a look across the room. People who understand that healing is nonlinear, messy, magical, and worth it.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">💫 Sacred Reciprocity</h2>

            <p>Remember: support is not a one-way flow. As you receive, give.</p>

            <p>Support can be quiet and simple:</p>

            <div class="support-list">
                <p>A listening ear</p>
                <p>A text that says "I see you"</p>
                <p>A home-cooked meal</p>
                <p>A shared laugh during a hard season</p>
                <p>An honest story that makes someone feel less alone</p>
            </div>

            <p>This is the soul of community. The sacred reciprocity that builds resilience. Giving and receiving. Offering and allowing. Witnessing and being witnessed.</p>

            <p>When you show up for others from a place of overflow, not obligation, you create a bond that strengthens everyone involved.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Your healing work creates space and permission for someone else's.</p>
                <p>Your story opens the door for another to share theirs.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="section-title">🌱 Building with Intention</h2>

            <p>Let your support system be intentional. Let it be intuitive. Let it be honest.</p>

            <p>When old wounds surface, those parts of you that believe you have to do it all alone, or that it's safer not to trust, meet them with compassion.</p>

            <p>Let people love you. Let them show up. Let yourself receive.</p>

            <p>The most beautiful support systems are not built through grand gestures. They are built through everyday moments of presence, honesty, and shared growth.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"You don't have to carry it all. You just have to remember: you're not alone."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">🏠 This is The Maggie Way</h2>

            <p>You do your part. You hold yourself. You stay responsible for your energy.</p>

            <p>You also allow yourself to lean in when it's safe. To soften. To belong.</p>

            <div class="closing">
                <p>Sending you so much love today, and every day.</p>
                <p>As always, notice what you notice.</p>
