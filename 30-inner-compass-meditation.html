        <h1>🧭 Inner Compass Meditation</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Returning to Your True North</p>

        <div class="meditation">
            <p>Imagine a balmy summer evening. The air is the perfect temperature, and as you breathe in, a sense of calm immediately begins to settle over you. You find yourself at the entrance of an open-air market, illuminated by golden string lights and framed by the rustling of silk tapestries in shades of amber, rose, and deep violet.</p>

            <p>As you inhale deeply, you're suddenly transported to scents from your childhood - fresh-cut grass, blooming jasmine, warm spices - and with it comes a profound sense of returning home.</p>

            <p>You move slowly through the market, immersed in the aromas of spices, florals, and incense. The lively chatter of merchants calling out their wares hums softly in the background. You're not here to buy anything. You're here to find something. You wander deeper, drawn toward a small stall tucked between drapery and candlelight.</p>

            <p>From within the stall, a woman with eyes like the ocean meets your gaze. She doesn't speak right away, but when she does, her voice lands like a memory:</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3rem; color: #FFD700;">"Your inner compass," she says, "is just a little misaligned."</p>

            <p>Music fills the air. But it's not just sound - it's frequency. A vibration that moves through your chest and radiates outward, warming every cell of your body. It unlocks something.</p>

            <p>The melody flows through you like water, like memory. It evokes something ancient. Something true. You feel emotion rise within - waves of hope, longing, release. They don't ask to be explained. They just need space. She gives you space.</p>

            <p>As she speaks, you begin to feel facets of yourself return to the surface - parts of you long buried beneath roles and responsibility. You realize you are not lost. You were just looking outside yourself for something that has always lived within.</p>

            <p>You notice a loosening in your chest. You breathe deeper. Slower. The world slows with you. She places a map in your hands - not a traditional one, but a living, shifting document. It pulses with light wherever you need to go next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>In that moment, you realize: this isn't about finding something outside of you. This is about remembering what's within you.</p>
        </div>

        <p>She doesn't give you answers. She doesn't tell you what to do. She simply reminds you that you already know. Because you do.</p>

        <p>The music fades into the background now, like a hum you carry in your chest. And you realize the most beautiful part of this encounter wasn't her - it was you showing up ready to receive.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #DAA520;">You are ready.</p>

        <p>To follow the pull. To trust the map. To return to your True North. Not because someone told you what it was - but because you finally got quiet enough to feel it.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>This is what it means to align your inner compass. To stop seeking, and start listening. To tune in, rather than tune out. To come home to yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;">When you do? The path will appear. Every time.</p>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h3>✨ Exercise: Calibrating Your Inner Compass</h3>
            
            <p>Find a quiet space. Sit or lie down in a way that feels safe, supported, and easeful.</p>

            <p>Close your eyes. Take a few slow breaths - long inhales through the nose, longer exhales through the mouth. Let your shoulders drop. Let your jaw unclench.</p>

            <p>Now, imagine the marketplace again. See the stall with silks blowing in the wind. Smell the spices. Hear the music. Now... place your hand over your heart and ask yourself:</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #FFD700;">"What direction feels true for me right now?"</p>

            <p>Don't try to think of the answer. Feel it. Let it come as a sensation, an image, a word, or even just a shift in your breath.</p>

            <p><strong>Notice where in your body your YES lives.</strong><br>
            Is it warm? Expansive? Grounded? Does it feel like lightness, openness, peace?</p>

            <p><strong>Now notice what NO feels like.</strong><br>
            Does it tighten your chest? Make your stomach drop? Close your throat?</p>

            <p>This is your compass. This is the language your body speaks when you finally stop to listen.</p>

            <p>If you feel stuck, try asking:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li>What am I being invited to release?</li>
                <li>What am I being guided toward?</li>
                <li>What would it feel like to trust myself more deeply?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can write down what comes through, or simply let the answers land inside you like seeds. You don't have to know everything right now. You just have to be willing to listen.</p>

            <p><strong>BONUS:</strong> If you're in a transitional season, try this every morning for one week. Before checking your phone or looking outside yourself - ask your compass: "What is today asking of me?"</p>
