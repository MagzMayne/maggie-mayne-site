            <h1>What Comes Next</h1>
            <p class="blog-subtitle">Turn the page. Light the match. This is what comes next.</p>
        </header>
        
        <article class="blog-content">
            <p>Healing will take you places you didn't expect.</p>

            <p>Wholeness will ask you to rise in ways your old self would have never dared. Often the version of you who shows up after the healing? She's louder. Funnier. Bolder. Unedited. A little unhinged. Absolutely unleashed.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>This book was written from the altar. From the massage table. From the quiet of the sacred in-between. It was poured from the part of me that whispers to the body and holds space for transformation. The part of me that knows how to breathe, how to soften, how to guide others home.</p>
            </div>

            <p>But healing also unlocked something else in me:</p>
            <p>A voice that didn't want to be quiet anymore. A rhythm that didn't follow the rules. A truth that was too loud for lowercase.</p>

            <div class="book-preview">
                <h3>She Tries / But Watch</h3>
                <p>That voice became a new book. Not a workbook. Not a manual.</p>
                <p><strong>A memoir. A reckoning. A holy reclamation dressed in chaos, wit, and wild feminine thunder.</strong></p>
                <p>It's not just a story. It's a movement.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you've ever made yourself small to keep the peace… If you've ever been the strong one, the good one, the rule follower… If you've ever been the one who tried, and tried, and tried… this next chapter is for you.</p>

            <p>It's for the girls who followed the format, and for the women who finally threw it out.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"Because now? We write our own rules. We burn the old templates and build temples from the ashes. We make scripture out of broken sentences. We begin again, bold and breathless."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">🏠 The Lighthouse Teaching</h2>

            <div class="lighthouse-section">
                <h3>Even the Lighthouse Needs Tending</h3>
                <p>There is a part of the journey no one tells you about. The part where you've done the work, cleared the trauma, opened the channels, and now you are the lighthouse. Steady. Luminous. Unshakable. People come to you for clarity, comfort, truth. And you give it, because it's who you are.</p>
                <p>But even the lighthouse needs someone to check the bulb. To wash the glass. To refill the oil.</p>
                <p><strong>Even the lighthouse needs tending.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>It's not weakness. It's not ego. It's the quiet ache of someone who holds so much light for others, and sometimes just wants to hear, "Thank you. That helped me. You matter."</p>

            <p>Divine Union, then, becomes the practice of showing up for yourself in the very ways you wish others would. It becomes the moment you clean your own glass. The breath where you refill your own oil. The whisper you offer back to your own heart: "You're doing beautifully. I see you."</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>You are the soul-lit one.</p>
                <p>You are still human.</p>
                <p><strong>Both are true. Both are worthy.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Your past doesn't disqualify your light. The wildness, the chaos, the versions of you who made questionable choices and loved people who couldn't meet you. Those were all initiations. They didn't dim your magic. They shaped it.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"You're not too much. You're just fully lit."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">✨ The Assignment</h2>

            <p>You are the lighthouse. Not the rescue boat. Not the diver. Not the one pulling others from the tide with bleeding hands.</p>

            <p>You are the one who stays, rooted to the rocky hill, anchored in storm and stillness, turning light in all directions so others can remember the way.</p>

            <p>The lighthouse's strength is in its stillness. Its medicine is in its presence. Its power is in the fact that it doesn't waver, doesn't flinch, doesn't shape-shift to earn love. It just shines.</p>

            <p>Not for attention. Not for applause. Not for validation. But because that's what it was made to do.</p>

            <div class="closing">
                <p><strong>She Tries / But Watch</strong> is coming soon.</p>
                <p>If you're still here? It means you're ready.</p>
