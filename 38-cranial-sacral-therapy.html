        <h1>🧠 Cranial Sacral Therapy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Gentle healing for your nervous system</p>

        <p>Cranial Sacral Therapy is a gentle, hands-on technique that supports the body's natural healing rhythm by working with the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and the subtle movements of the cranial bones.</p>

        <p>This isn't aggressive manipulation. It's profound listening. It's meeting the body where it is and inviting it to release what it's been holding.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Restrictions in the cranial sacral system can develop from physical injuries, emotional trauma, stress, or even birth experiences. These restrictions can lead to pain, dysfunction, and a sense of being "stuck" in the body.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p>Through gentle, intuitive touch, Cranial Sacral Therapy helps release held patterns, allowing the body to return to its natural rhythm and harmony.</p>

        <p>Once restrictions are identified, the practitioner uses very light touch and gentle manipulation to help release the tension. The goal is not to forcefully manipulate the bones, but rather to assist the body in releasing the restrictions itself.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>This gentle approach is what makes CST so effective for people who are sensitive to touch or who have experienced trauma. The process often involves a deep sense of relaxation and an expansion of awareness.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Fascial Connection</h2>

        <p>One important aspect of CST is its focus on the fascial system. Fascia is a network of connective tissue that surrounds and supports all the structures in your body. Restrictions in the fascia can restrict movement, causing pain and discomfort.</p>

        <p>CST addresses these fascial restrictions by gently mobilizing the tissues and encouraging the release of chronic tension patterns. This fascial release can be particularly beneficial for people with chronic pain conditions.</p>

        <div class="benefits">
            <p><strong>Benefits include:</strong></p>
            <p>✨ Migraine relief • TMJ dysfunction • Chronic neck and back pain</p>
            <p>✨ Stress and tension reduction • Central nervous system disorders</p>
            <p>✨ Post-concussion symptoms • Emotional release • Deep relaxation</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Beyond the Physical</h2>

        <p>The benefits of Cranial Sacral Therapy extend far beyond the physical realm. Many clients report experiencing profound emotional and spiritual shifts during CST sessions.</p>

        <p>The release of long-held physical tension often facilitates an emotional release, allowing stored trauma and emotions to surface and be processed. This process can be deeply cathartic, helping clients to integrate past experiences and move forward in their lives.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Some clients describe a truly spiritual experience—vividly recalling memories, seeing colors, or reporting a never-before-experienced sense of wholeness and connection.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Self-Care Practice</h2>

        <p>While professional CST offers the deepest transformation, you can begin connecting with your own cranial sacral rhythm at home.</p>

        <p>Place your hands gently behind your head at the base of your skull, right where the neck meets the head. Or softly cradle your forehead with steady, warm hands. The key is softness. No force. No pushing. Just presence.</p>

        <p>Close your eyes and imagine golden light pouring down through your crown, spiraling through your spine, wrapping your entire nervous system in calm.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>You don't need to do everything perfectly to participate in your own care. You don't need to "fix" yourself to come home to your body. You only need to be willing. Be soft. Be present. Breathe.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Because the rhythm is already there. You are the MAGIC.</p>
