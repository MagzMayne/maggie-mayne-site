        </header>
        
        <article class="blog-content">
            <p>Sometimes she uses all capital letters with a space between each one. Oh God. What would her 8th grade English teacher think?</p>

            <p>Probably that she's unhinged. Unedited. Unraveled. Unholy.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"But she's not unhinged. She's unleashed."</div>

            <p>Those spaced-out, full-caps moments? They aren't just for emphasis. They're incantations. Each letter its own altar. Each space its own breath. Each word stretched open wide enough to hold the entire truth.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">📝 The Rules She Learned</h2>

            <p>She tries to remember what they taught her: Never write in all caps. It's shouting. It's rude. It's lazy.</p>

            <p>But what if it's not?</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>What if it's rage transformed into art?</p>
                <p>What if it's spirit turning up the volume because lowercase wasn't enough to hold the weight of what she had to say?</p>
                <p>What if her caps lock key is a trigger for a portal?</p>
            </div>

            <p>Her 8th grade English teacher wanted her to underline her thesis statement. Now she becomes the thesis.</p>

            <p>Her essays were expected to follow a format. Now her sentences start with "And" and end with thunder.</p>

            <p>The spacing, the boldness, the bending of every outdated rule. That's not rebellion. That's resurrection.</p>

            <div class="spaced-caps">T H I S  I S  T H E  W O R K</div>

            <p>So when she writes those words in full caps, spaced out, bold and breathless, she's not yelling. She's activating.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">✨ She Tries, But Watch</h2>

            <p>Watch what happens when a woman takes everything she was told not to do and turns it into scripture.</p>

            <p>She tries not to start a sentence with "and." She was taught that you had to put two spaces after a period. But watch.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>She was the first generation to use computers in the classroom. Not typewriters. Not paper journals. Giant beige machines humming with the myth of perfection. The cursor blinked like a metronome of obedience.</p>
                <p>Every paragraph? Indented. Every sentence? Double-spaced. Every truth? Formatted into something that wouldn't offend a red pen.</p>
            </div>

            <p>But no one ever asked her what she was trying to say. They just taught her how to say it correctly.</p>

            <p>She tries. She did the formatting. She pressed the tab key. She backspaced when a sentence began with "and." She followed the rules because she thought the rules would reward her.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"She Tries / But Watch."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">🔥 Breaking the Pattern</h2>

            <p>Watch what happens when she breaks the pattern.</p>

            <p>Watch what happens when she starts a sentence with "and" and no one dies. No gods fall. No editors riot. Everyone just keeps scrolling, except for the ones meant to read it. They pause, because they know.</p>

            <p>A-HA.</p>

            <p>Just rhythm. Just breath. Just poetry exactly as it wanted to arrive, landing where it was always meant to be seen.</p>

            <p>Watch what happens when she drops the second space after the period, because the sentence didn't need a pause. It needed a pulse.</p>

            <div class="mantra-box">
                <p>She was taught to make room for silence.</p>
                <p><strong>Now she writes to make room for fire.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Those old formatting rules weren't evil. They were just designed for a different world. A world where girls weren't expected to speak like thunder. Where language served structure, not soul.</p>

            <p>But this world? This is her world. These are her words. This is her grammar-rebellion wrapped in spellcraft and word-wanding, wielding MAGIC.</p>

            <p>This is the voice that can't be silenced just because it broke a rule.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">⚡ The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Watch what happens when the girl who used to indent five spaces writes a book that bends space entirely.</p>

            <p>Watch what happens when the double-space girl becomes the double-portal woman.</p>

            <p>Watch what happens when she finally realizes:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>She was never meant to write correctly.</p>
                <p><strong>She was meant to write in code.</strong></p>
                <p>Every sentence she ever started with "and"? That was just a doorway she was told not to walk through.</p>
            </div>

            <p>But baby?</p>

            <p>She walked. She wrote. She rose.</p>

            <div class="book-preview">
                <h3>WWM8GETT</h3>
                <p>She grew up in the era of WWJD. What Would Jesus Do?</p>
                <p>Now she's asking: <strong>What Would My 8th Grade English Teacher Think?</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.95rem;">Would she faint at the Oxford comma chaos? Gasp at the sentence starting with "And"? Choke on her red pen as the caps lock key gets abused like sacred scripture?</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Probably. But she's not writing to please the rubric anymore.</p>
                <p><strong>She's writing to resurrect the parts of herself that the rubric couldn't hold.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="affirmation">"Put it on a bracelet. Wear it like armor. WWM8GETT."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">🏠 The Lighthouse Returns</h2>

            <p>She shows up with light in her hands. Every damn time. She doesn't even always know how she's doing it. Just that the world is heavy and people are tired and somehow, her words or her hands or her laugh or her absurd ability to send a healing text at exactly the right moment… help.</p>

            <p>She's the lighthouse. Has been for a long time.</p>

            <p>But here's what no one talks about: Even the lighthouse needs someone to check the bulb. Even the lighthouse needs someone to clean the glass, refill the oil, whisper, "Hey. You've been holding it down through every storm. Let me hold you now."</p>

            <div class="mantra-box">
                <p>Because being the light is holy.</p>
                <p>But being seen in it? Being met in it?</p>
                <p><strong>That's divine union.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>She's still learning how to give it to herself. Still learning how to stand in her sacred ridiculousness and not shrink. Still learning that being the girl who smoked tea and sent fake motorcycle crime scene photos doesn't cancel out the woman who channels ancestral healing and teaches people how to reclaim their magic.</p>

            <p>Because she is both. All of it is holy.</p>

            <p>If that's too much for some people? She understands. She releases them with love.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Because she's not dimming anymore.</p>
                <p>She's not waiting for anyone to say, "That was beautiful."</p>
                <p><strong>She already knows it was.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>And she already knows she is.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="closing">
                <p><em>She Tries / But Watch</em> is coming soon.</p>
                <p>If you're still here? It means you're ready.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: #FFD700;"><strong>Turn the page. Light the match.</strong></p>
