        <h1>🎉 Do the Things That Make You Happy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Joy is not optional. It's part of your soul's daily nutrition.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"Let's be clear - joy is not a luxury. It's not optional. It's not something you earn after being productive. It's part of your soul's daily nutrition."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Engaging in hobbies and activities that bring you joy is essential for maintaining a balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
        
        <p>True happiness looks different for everyone. What lights someone else up might do absolutely nothing for you - and that's okay. That's the point. You are allowed to find what makes you feel most alive, most free, most grounded. You don't have to justify it. You don't have to explain it. You just have to give yourself permission to feel good.</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"The things that make you happy aren't frivolous - they're sacred."</div>
        
        <p>They are often the very things that reconnect you to your essence and remind you that life can be soft, sweet, and full of sparkle. When you engage with joy on purpose, you shift your entire frequency.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>What Joy Looks Like For Me</h2>
        
        <p>For me? Sometimes it's blasting music in the kitchen while making pesto from scratch. Sometimes it's talking to my ducks, my kitties, my dog. (Yes, I talk to them. Yes, they talk back.)</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes it's watching something silly and letting myself fully belly laugh. Sometimes - it's sticking googly eyes on things that absolutely are not expected to have googly eyes. Like my water bottle. Or the blender. Or the bananas.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:center; color:#FFD700; font-size:1.1rem;">Have you ever seen a sad banana with googly eyes? You can't. It's impossible.</p>
        
        <p>Those little moments of ridiculousness? They're holy. They keep me soft. They keep me, me.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Your Joy Doesn't Have to Make Sense</h2>
        
        <div class="joy-list">
            <p>Paint something - a vase, a lamp, furniture you found by the trash can</p>
            <p>Sing loudly in the car</p>
            <p>Plant something and name it</p>
            <p>Rearrange your books by vibe or color instead of genre</p>
            <p>Spend ten minutes in the sun doing absolutely nothing</p>
            <p>Dance in the living room</p>
            <p>Watch the birds</p>
            <p>Read something deliciously cheesy</p>
            <p>Make art with your kids. Make art like a kid.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>It all counts.</p>
        
        <p>Joy gives you a sense of purpose. It unlocks creativity. It provides a safe space for self-expression that's not tied to productivity or outcomes.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"It is not selfish to prioritize your happiness. In fact, it's your sacred responsibility."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise-box">
            <h3>🎉 Exercise: What Makes You Feel Happy?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Make a list of things that bring you joy - big or small.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">✨ When you think of feeling happy, what comes to mind?</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">✨ What lights you up?</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">✨ What have you been waiting to let yourself enjoy again?</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">✨ Can you add at least one thing that makes you happy into every day?</p>
            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem; font-style:italic;">Start small if you need to. One song. One smile. One moment of remembering what it feels like to be you.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"Joy is medicine. Go get your dose."</div>
