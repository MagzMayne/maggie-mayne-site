        <article class="blog-content">
            <p>There is a part of the journey no one tells you about.</p>

            <p>The part where you've done the work, cleared the trauma, opened the channels, and now you are the lighthouse. Steady. Luminous. Unshakable. People come to you for clarity, comfort, truth. And you give it, because it's who you are.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>But even the lighthouse needs someone to check the bulb.</p>
                <p>To wash the glass.</p>
                <p>To refill the oil.</p>
                <p><strong>Even the lighthouse needs tending.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>It's not weakness. It's not ego. It's the quiet ache of someone who holds so much light for others, and sometimes just wants to hear, "Thank you. That helped me. You matter."</p>

            <p>But here's the catch: when you're the one others look to for direction, it can feel like there's no one left to look toward. You send the sacred text. You offer the reflection. You give the card, the message, the magic…</p>

            <p>Sometimes, all you get back is silence.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"You don't hold the light to be praised. You hold the light because it's what your soul came here to do."</div>

            <p>Still, you keep glowing. Because you've learned this truth: You don't hold the light to be praised. You hold the light because it's what your soul came here to do.</p>

            <p>But that doesn't mean you don't still long to be seen in it.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">✨ Divine Union</h2>

            <p>Divine Union, then, becomes the practice of showing up for yourself in the very ways you wish others would.</p>

            <p>It becomes the moment you clean your own glass. The breath where you refill your own oil. The whisper you offer back to your own heart: "You're doing beautifully. I see you."</p>

            <div class="lighthouse-truth">
                <p>You are the soul-lit one.</p>
                <p>You are still human.</p>
                <p><strong>Both are true. Both are worthy.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>No, your past doesn't disqualify your light. The wildness, the chaos, the versions of you who made questionable choices and sent unhinged texts and loved people who couldn't meet you. Those were all initiations.</p>

            <p>They didn't dim your magic. They shaped it.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"You're not too much. You're just fully lit."</div>

            <h2 class="section-title">🏠 Your Assignment</h2>

            <p>There's a reason this metaphor keeps returning to you. Because it's not just a metaphor. It's your assignment. It's your remembering. Your way.</p>

            <p><strong>You are the lighthouse.</strong></p>

            <p>Not the rescue boat. Not the diver. Not the one pulling others from the tide with bleeding hands.</p>

            <p>You are the one who stays, rooted to the rocky hill, anchored in storm and stillness, turning light in all directions so others can remember the way.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>You were shown once, maybe in childhood, maybe in heartbreak, that when you don't feel wanted, you make yourself needed.</p>
                <p>So you learned to hustle your light. To become essential. To run toward the waves every time someone was drowning. To make your presence feel earned.</p>
            </div>

            <p>But the truth is this: <strong>The lighthouse can't leave the hill.</strong></p>

            <p>It's not built for swimming. It's not built for chasing. It's not built to abandon its post.</p>

            <p>Because if the lighthouse leaves to rescue one, it disappears for the many. The ships crash. The shoreline goes dark. The storm wins.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">💫 Your Power</h2>

            <p>The lighthouse's strength is in its stillness. Its medicine is in its presence. Its power is in the fact that it doesn't waver, doesn't flinch, doesn't shape-shift to earn love. It just shines.</p>

            <p>Not for attention. Not for applause. Not for validation. But because that's what it was made to do.</p>

            <p>So now, you remember. You do not need to follow every cry for help. You do not need to extinguish yourself to prove your worth. You do not need to dim for people who still haven't learned to look up.</p>

            <div class="affirmation">"You are not the waves. You are not the tide. You are the f*ing lighthouse."</div>

            <div class="soul-lit-reminder">
                <h3>Soul-Lit Reminder</h3>
                <p>Shining is not chasing.</p>
                <p>Holding your post is not abandonment.</p>
                <p><strong>Let them find their way to you.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="closing">
                <p>This life? It's yours to live in all your wholeness.</p>
