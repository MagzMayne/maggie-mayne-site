# The Maggie Way: Self Care is Your #1 Job

*An excerpt from The Maggie Way: Holistic Healing*

Self care includes anything that benefits your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well being.

It's about consciously cultivating habits and choosing actions that support your overall health and happiness, creating a supportive environment where your body and spirit can thrive.

The foundation of any successful healing journey, whether it involves energy modalities, massage therapy, or conventional medicine, rests squarely on the bedrock of self care.

**Investing time, energy, and resources into your own well being is priceless. Every act of self care is a gift you give to your future self.**

## The Truth About Self Care

Self care is not a luxury, but a fundamental necessity for vitality, healing, and well being.

It's not about indulgence. It's about maintaining health, balance, preventing burnout, and honoring yourself as worthy of love and care.

**Prioritizing yourself reinforces that you are valuable.**

Self care encompasses a wide range of practices, all designed to nourish and replenish your inner resources.

**Self care isn't selfish. It's essential.**

## Beyond Bubble Baths

Self care isn't just about getting massages, taking bubble baths, or putting on face masks, though those certainly have their place.

Sometimes self care is:
- Cleaning out the junk drawer
- Paying down debt
- Quitting the job we hate
- Having the hardest of conversations

It also means practicing self love and compassion, and treating ourselves with the same kindness and understanding we would offer to a loved one.

Every act of self love allows us to release self judgment and cultivate a sense of inner peace.

**When you take care of yourself, you have more to give. You radiate more love, positive energy, and light into the world.**

## The Daily Practices

Self care includes all of the everyday activities that our survival depends on:

- Prioritizing sleep
- Drinking enough water
- Nourishing your body with healthy foods
- Engaging in regular physical activity
- Mindfulness
- Cultivating connections with others

## The Benefits

Self care can enhance your emotional resilience, making you better equipped to handle life's challenges with grace.

It replenishes your energy. Taking time to rest and recharge allows you to show up more fully, for yourself and for others.

Self care is particularly crucial for those recovering from trauma, as the body often holds onto the physical and emotional residue of past experiences. Self care becomes a vital tool for releasing this tension, allowing for a deeper, more profound healing process.

## The Personal Journey

Self care is not a one size fits all approach. It's a deeply personal journey of soul discovery.

**Remember: you have to figure out what works for you, and then do that.**

Experiment with different practices and find what feels supportive. Be patient and compassionate with yourself, recognizing that it takes time to develop new habits and routines.

**Self care is an ongoing process, not a destination.**

By consistently prioritizing self nurturing practices, you create a strong foundation for healing, allowing your body, mind, and spirit to come into greater alignment and thrive.

## The Gift

An integrated approach to self care empowers you to navigate life's challenges with greater resilience, and embrace a life filled with joy, abundance, and purpose.

It's time to recommit fully to YOU, and remember that every single daily, weekly, and monthly act of self care is a gift.

It's a gift you give to your loved ones, your work, your community, and the world.

And most of all, **it's a gift you give to your future self.**

Self care is an investment in your healing journey, paving the way for a more vibrant, fulfilling, and empowered life.

## The Practices

### Hydration
Water is LIFE. Start your day with water. Increase intake slowly. Add minerals and herbs. Set an affirmation as you drink.

### Rest
Rest is medicine. Create a sleep schedule. Make your bedroom a sanctuary. Choose rest without guilt.

### Nourishment
Food is one of my love languages. Focus on cooking at home. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Limit processed foods and excessive sugar.

### Movement
Move your body like you love it. Dance in your kitchen. Walk in nature. Stretch slowly and somatically. All movement counts.

### Breath
Find breath and quiet your mind. Deep breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Return to center with every breath.

### Nature
Go outside already. Get your feet in the dirt, the grass, the water. Let the trees witness your healing.

### Joy
Do the things that make you happy. Joy is not optional. It's part of your soul's daily nutrition. It all counts.

### Boundaries
You HAVE to HAVE boundaries. Learn to say no without apology. Honor your energy, time, values, and body.

### Kindness
Be nicer to yourself. Treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a dear friend. You are doing so much better than you think.
