        <h1>🧘 Centering in the Moment</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The Radical Act of Being Present</p>

        <p>In a world that constantly pulls us in a million directions, presence is a radical act of power.</p>

        <p>Centering yourself isn't about shutting everything out. It's about calling yourself in. It's the art of returning to your body, to your breath, and to the now - even when everything around you is moving fast.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>Presence is healing. It is the bridge between your body and your awareness. It's where your intuition speaks. It's where your nervous system finds its rhythm again.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Power of Quiet Moments</h2>

        <p>I've found over the years - both personally and in client sessions - that some of the most profound shifts happen in the quietest moments. Not during the big breakthrough, but during the pause. The exhale. The stillness between words.</p>

        <p>We don't always need to "figure it out." Sometimes we just need to feel. To notice. To hold space for what's there.</p>

        <h2>Are You Here?</h2>

        <p>One of my favorite things to ask myself and clients is: "Are you here?"</p>

        <p>Not in your calendar. Not in your head. Not on your phone. But here. In your body. In your breath. In this moment.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Because the truth is, you can't heal what you won't feel. You can't release what you won't witness. And you can't transform what you refuse to be present with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h3>✨ Exercise: Return to You</h3>
            <p>This is one of my most-used practices because it works. You can do it anywhere - before a session, at a red light, in the middle of a full-blown overwhelm moment.</p>
            
            <div class="exercise-step">
                <p>Wherever you are, pause.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exercise-step">
                <p>Take a few slow, intentional breaths - in through the nose, out through the mouth.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exercise-step">
                <p>Call even more of yourself back to yourself.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exercise-step">
                <p>Feel your feet on the ground.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exercise-step">
                <p>Place a hand on your chest or belly, and just notice:<br>
                What is your intention right now?<br>
                Are there any places in your body that feel tight, tense, or holding?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exercise-step">
                <p><strong>And the BIG one:</strong> Are they even yours?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>We carry so much that isn't ours - energy, emotions, expectations. Sometimes we're just holding on because no one taught us how to let go.</p>

        <h2>Coming Home to Your Body</h2>

        <p>I love using this practice to "come home" to my body. Breath is a tether. Sensation is a teacher. The simple act of noticing - without judgment - is transformative.</p>

        <p>You return to YOU.</p>

        <h2>Sacred Timing</h2>

        <p>This practice becomes even more potent when paired with sacred timing - like during the New Moon.</p>

        <p>The New Moon is a cosmic reset. A blank canvas. A powerful invitation to pause, drop in, and plant your intentions from a place of truth and stillness. When you're fully present, your intentions carry more weight. They're not reactive. They're rooted.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>Come back to this practice anytime life feels loud. You don't need perfect silence to be present. You just need to choose you, in this moment.</p>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #FFD700;">That's where the MAGIC begins.</p>
