# The Maggie Way: Trust Yourself and Follow Your Intuition

*An excerpt from The Maggie Way: Holistic Healing*

---

I could tell you dozens of stories, maybe even a hundred, about times I *knew*.

I mean deep down, bone deep, soul whispering *knew*.

The kind of knowing that isn't loud or pushy but speaks in subtle, sacred nudges. That quiet inner voice that says, "This isn't it," or "Turn here," or "Don't say yes just to be nice."

Yet... I didn't always listen.

## The Hard Lessons

Some of the hardest lessons in my life have come from ignoring that inner voice.

I've stayed too long. Said yes when I should've just walked (ran) away. Trusted people I knew, *knew*, were not aligned.

**There's not a single story I can tell you where I followed my intuition and it led me somewhere wrong.**

But I've got plenty where I didn't follow it, and it cost me.

That's why I believe learning to trust your intuition, your inner compass, your soul's GPS, is one of the most important things you will *ever* do in this lifetime.

## The Truth

**No one else can know what's right for you.**

They're not in your body. They don't carry your history. They're not walking your path.

How often do we override our own knowing to accommodate someone else's opinion?

How often do we silence that sacred inner whisper just to stay comfortable, likable, or avoid conflict?

I've been there. More times than I can count.

## When the Compass Gets Lost

There were seasons in my life when my inner compass was programmed by trauma, distorted by survival mode, spinning wildly and frantically trying to find True North.

In those times, I often handed my power over, asking other people for answers, permission, or insight.

Let me be honest: sometimes their advice came from a good place. **That didn't mean it was right for me.**

I've learned the hard way that not everyone who gives you advice is invested in your best outcome. Sometimes their advice is rooted in their own fears, limitations, or projections.

**If you're not deeply connected to your own inner truth, it's easy to mistake their path for your own.**

## The Recalibration

Here's the MAGIC: Every time my compass malfunctioned, it was an invitation to recalibrate.

To pause. To come back home to myself.

When you start truly tuning in, listening to your body, your gut, your higher self, you begin to realize how *wise* you are.

You begin to feel that steady inner yes, that sacred no.

You start making choices that honor your integrity, your energy, your truth.

**The more you trust yourself, the louder your intuition becomes.**

## The Practice

This isn't about never making mistakes. It's about honoring the process of learning, discerning, and reconnecting again and again.

It's about realizing that the most powerful guidance system you'll ever have doesn't live outside you. **It lives within YOU.**

So yes, seek wisdom. Ask questions. Be open.

But remember: if someone doesn't have what you want, or live a life that inspires you, maybe, just maybe, they aren't your best advisor, or maybe it's a test.

You are allowed to gather input, but you don't have to take it all in.

You are allowed to ask for support, but still trust yourself most.

Because you're the one who has to live with your choices. You're the one who wakes up in your body, in your bed, with your life.

No one else.

## The Inner Compass Meditation

Imagine a balmy summer evening. The air is the perfect temperature, and as you breathe in, a sense of calm immediately begins to settle over you.

You find yourself strolling through a vibrant marketplace in a far off land, somewhere timeless, where the air itself feels enchanted.

As you inhale deeply, you're suddenly transported to scents from your childhood, fresh cut grass, blooming jasmine, warm spices, and with it comes a profound feeling of safety. Familiar. Like home.

You move slowly through the market, immersed in the aromas of spices, florals, and incense. The lively chatter of merchants calling out their wares hums in the background, a rhythmic buzz of aliveness.

Then, you see it. A small, hidden stall, draped in vibrant silks, lit softly by candlelight. Mystical trinkets sparkle in the fading light. Something about it beckons you.

From within the stall, a woman with eyes like the ocean meets your gaze. She doesn't speak right away, but when she does, her voice lands like a memory you didn't know you were missing.

**"Your inner compass," she says, "is just a little misaligned."**

Music fills the air. But it's not just sound. It's frequency. A vibration that moves through your chest and radiates outward, warming every cell of your being.

She places a map in your hands, not a traditional one, but a cosmic chart of stars and symbols.

**"Your soul has always known the way," she says. "But the noise of the world made you forget."**

In that moment, you realize: this isn't about finding something *outside* of you.

**This is about remembering what's within you.**

You are ready. To follow the pull. To trust the map. To return to your True North.

Not because someone told you what it was, but because you finally got quiet enough to feel it.

## Exercise: Calibrating Your Inner Compass

Find a quiet space. Sit or lie down in a way that feels safe, supported, and easeful.

Close your eyes. Take a few slow breaths, long inhales through the nose, longer exhales through the mouth.

Let your shoulders drop. Let your jaw unclench. Let your energy soften.

Now, place your hand over your heart. Ask, silently or aloud:

**"What direction feels true for me right now?"**

Don't try to think of the answer. Feel it. Let it come as a sensation, an image, a word, or even just a shift in your breath.

**Notice where in your body your YES lives.**

Is it warm? Expansive? Grounded? Does it feel like lightness, openness, peace?

**Now notice what NO feels like.**

Does it tighten your chest? Make your stomach drop? Close your throat?

**This is your compass. This is the language your body speaks. It has always been there, waiting for you to listen.**

---

So trust yourself. Trust your gut. Trust the pull.

Even if you don't have all the answers yet, especially then, that's okay...

That's FANTASTIC.

**You have you. That is more than enough.**
