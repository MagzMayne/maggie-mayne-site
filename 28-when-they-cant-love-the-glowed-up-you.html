        <h1>🔥 When They Can't Love the Glowed-Up You</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">For the Ones Still Rising Through Silence</p>

        <p>This journey started with water. Simple. Foundational. Elemental.</p>

        <p>Somehow - through breath and boundaries, lymph and letting go, massage and moonlight - we ended up here. In the quiet reckoning of what it means to actually heal.</p>

        <p>Healing isn't just about hydration and herbs. It's about becoming. Becoming costs something.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>What no one tells you when you start the self-care path - the real path, the one with actual fire and broken mirrors, no wifi and no maps - is that people leave.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Nobody really tells you that but even if we did you would say not me... That's not going to be my experience. Sorry, but yeah - you - I guess that's one of the rules we have not loopholed yet - Not everyone is coming with you.</p>

        <h2>Who Stays, Who Goes</h2>

        <p>Some will. The real ones. The ready ones. The soul-aligned ones.</p>

        <p>But others? They'll shrink. They'll ghost. They'll whisper. They'll turn your own words against you like they weren't spoon-fed from your table.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>You'll hear your teachings come back in someone else's voice, stripped of nuance, wrapped in ego, echoed without reverence. It will sting. Because they got that MAGIC from you.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The clients, friends or family who soaked in your medicine for years, then vanished when your glow-up started to shine a little too bright... Ouch.</p>

        <div class="poetry">
            The ones who loved the version of you who bled for them but couldn't handle the version of you who healed. Yuck.<br><br>
            The ones who cheered when you were exhausted, but went silent when you started thriving. Gross. Also Gone.
        </div>

        <p>I know it hurts. I've been there. I've felt that silence like a slap.</p>

        <h2>The Sting is Part of the Medicine</h2>

        <p>Here's the thing: That sting? That silence? It's part of the medicine.</p>

        <p>When you speak from the mountaintop - the one you crawled up with bloody knees and a broken heart - people don't always clap. Sometimes, they freeze. Sometimes, they unfollow. Sometimes, they pretend they never knew you.</p>

        <p>You? You'll suddenly start to question everything. You'll wonder if you went too far. If you should've watered it down. If you lost people you were never meant to lose.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>Hear me now: You didn't lose them. You found yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You became the frequency they weren't ready for. The version of you that doesn't apologize for being awake. The voice that doesn't ask for permission to be free.</p>

        <h2>The Unexpected Places</h2>

        <p>The hater energy and evil eye comes from the most unexpected places. Most of the time it comes from the people you fed. People you loved. People you supported without reservation.</p>

        <p>It's happened to me. More than once. I've learned to let it.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Because those exits? Those silent unfollows, those copy-paste echoes, those cold shoulders at the grocery store? They clear the field. They show you who's not meant to walk with you into the next version of YOU. They remind you that your truth doesn't need an audience. It needs resonance.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>When Crickets Are Sacred</h2>

        <p>So when you send the email that pours through you unedited, unscripted, unstoppable - and all you get is crickets? Know that the real ones felt it. Even if they didn't reply.</p>

        <p>You're not crazy. You're just clear. You're not alone. You're just ahead of the timeline.</p>

        <p>This isn't about applause. This is about alignment.</p>

        <p>Yes - sometimes the silence is deafening. Sometimes the leaving hurts more than the staying ever did. Sometimes you want to scream, "I was there for YOU!"</p>

        <div class="poetry">
            If you've made it this far -<br>
            If you're still standing -<br>
            Still soft -<br>
            Still sovereign -<br><br>
            You're not just healing -<br>
            You're leading.
        </div>
