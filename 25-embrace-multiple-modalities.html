        <h1>✨ Embrace Multiple Modalities</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Do ALL the THINGS</p>

        <p>This work is not one-size-fits-all - and it never should be.</p>

        <p>As an author (yes, I'm still getting used to saying that out loud, but here we are, page after page, becoming), intuitive, light worker, spiritual mentor, bodyworker, and wellness professional, I work within an ever-expanding ecosystem of healing modalities.</p>

        <p>My calling is to create a safe, sacred space for people to return to themselves. When we show up with authenticity and allow ourselves to be witnessed in our healing, transformation happens. It happens in the most unexpected ways.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>I believe healing becomes possible when we stop compartmentalizing. When we stop separating the spiritual from the physical, the body from the emotions, or the heart from the nervous system.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>My Healing Journey</h2>

        <p>I learned this the hard way. There was a season of my life when I tried to "heal" in isolation. I wanted one tool, one answer, one clear path. But the truth is, my healing came through a beautiful blend - massage that unlocked my tissues, journaling that unlocked my mind, sound that moved my grief, and ritual that anchored my soul.</p>

        <p>It came through Reiki sessions that cracked my heart wide open, through lymphatic work that cleared grief from my tissues, and through Cranial Sacral Therapy that helped me feel safe in my own body again.</p>

        <h2>Multidimensional Healing</h2>

        <p>This is why I now offer a unique combination of in-person sessions, remote offerings, destination retreats, classes, workshops, and speaking events. What you need will be completely unique to YOU.</p>

        <p>You bring YOU. I bring ME. Together, we create a completely customized healing plan. I bring my intuition, my presence, and the decades of experience I've gathered on and off the table. You bring your willingness, your questions, your whole self - even the parts you think are "too much."</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Sometimes we use movement. Sometimes stillness. Sometimes sound. Sometimes silence. This is multidimensional healing - the full-spectrum kind that doesn't ask you to choose just one path.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Modalities</h2>

        <ul class="modality-list">
            <li><strong>Cranial Sacral Therapy</strong> - Helps restore rhythm to your nervous system and melts long-held tension in your spine and skull.</li>
            <li><strong>Lymphatic Drainage</strong> - Works directly with the water element in your body, helping you detox physically, emotionally, and energetically.</li>
            <li><strong>Reiki and CCT™</strong> - Move and release stagnant energy that no longer serves you, reconnecting you to your intuition and purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Massage Therapy</strong> - 22+ years of bodywork mastery. Touch that transforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Sound Healing</strong> - Crystal bowls, tuning forks, frequency medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Essential Oils</strong> - Plant medicine for body and spirit.</li>
            <li><strong>Flower Essences</strong> - Vibrational remedies for emotional balance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These aren't just techniques - they're doorways. Each one opens something different. Each one speaks to a different part of your system.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>

        <p>I've seen miracles. I've seen clients walk again after injury. I've seen chronic pain dissolve. I've witnessed trauma shift, nervous systems regulate, and souls return to bodies that had been abandoned for decades.</p>

        <p>Let me be clear - this isn't about chasing the next new thing. This is about having options. It's about listening to the wisdom of your body and offering it exactly what it needs. Sometimes that means deep tissue massage. Sometimes that means silence and stillness. Sometimes that means all of it at once.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>Healing is personal - Always, in all the ways.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Full Healing Ecosystem</h2>

        <p>That's why I also support clients in creating a full healing ecosystem - referrals, resources, self-care tools, and practices that go beyond the table. Because when we stop outsourcing our power and start coming back to our bodies, our breath, and our brilliance - we remember.</p>

        <p>We remember that the healing we seek has always been inside us. We just needed someone to remind us how to access it.</p>

        <p>Healing isn't just about releasing symptoms. It's about reclaiming joy. It's about feeling alive again.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>So yes - do ALL the things. Try all the modalities that speak to your soul. Follow the nudges. Trust the pull. Know that whether we're working together in person, across the country, or across lifetimes - The Maggie Way is here to remind you:</p>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #FFD700;">You are whole. You are powerful. You are already healing. You don't have to do it alone.</p>
