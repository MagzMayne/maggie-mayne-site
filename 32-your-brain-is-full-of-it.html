        <h1>🧠 Your Brain Is "Full of It"</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The stories we've absorbed aren't always truth</p>

        <p>Let's be honest. Your brain has absorbed a lot of static over the years. Messages from family, from culture, from media, from past versions of yourself who were just trying to survive.</p>

        <p>Not all of those messages are true. In fact, most of them aren't.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Your brain has been programmed by fear, by comparison, by other people's projections, and by experiences that shaped you but don't define you.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Static We Carry</h2>

        <p>From the moment we're born, we begin absorbing information—consciously and unconsciously. We learn what's "good" and "bad," what's acceptable, what will get us love, and what might get us rejected.</p>

        <p>By the time we're adults, we've internalized thousands of beliefs that we never consciously chose. These beliefs run in the background like old software, influencing our decisions, our relationships, our self-worth—often without us even knowing.</p>

        <h2>Your Soul Knows Better</h2>

        <p>Here's the good news: your soul knows what's true. Beneath all that static, beneath all the programming, there's a part of you that remembers who you really are.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>We can't stop suffering unless we accept; we can't accept what we haven't understood. Understanding begins when we question the stories we've been told—including the ones we tell ourselves.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Catching the Lies</h2>

        <p>When negative thoughts arise, catch them. Don't let them run unchallenged. Ask yourself:</p>

        <p>Is this true? Really true?<br>
        Where did this belief come from?<br>
        What would my soul say about this?<br>
        Is this thought serving my highest good?</p>

        <p>Most of the cruel things we say to ourselves would never come out of our mouths if we were talking to someone we love. Why do we accept that treatment from ourselves?</p>

        <h2>Replace the Lie with Truth</h2>

        <p>Once you've caught the lie, replace it. Not with toxic positivity or denial—but with actual truth. The kind of truth your soul recognizes.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Your words are your wand. What you speak, you create. What you repeat, you reinforce. Choose wisely.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You are not too much. You are not too little. You are not broken. You are not behind. You are exactly where you need to be, becoming exactly who you came here to be.</p>

        <h2>The Practice</h2>

        <p>Every day, practice discernment. Notice the voice in your head. Notice when it sounds like fear, like comparison, like old wounds talking. And every time you catch it, gently redirect.</p>

        <p>This isn't about silencing yourself. It's about becoming the conscious author of your inner dialogue instead of letting old programming run the show.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>Your brain may be "full of it"—but you have the power to empty what no longer serves you and fill yourself with truth, love, and wisdom instead.</p>
        </div>
