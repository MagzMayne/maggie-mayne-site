        <h1>🎯 Figure Out What You Really Want</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Your words are your wand</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"Setting intentions isn't just about hoping or wishing for something to magically appear. It's a conscious, focused act of directing your energy and will toward a specific outcome. It's how you begin telling the universe what you're ready for - and how you begin telling yourself the truth about what you actually want."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In every client session, we focus on intentions. We begin with the intentions for the session itself, and then we zoom out and look at what I like to call our "all-the-time" intentions - the deeper soul desires we carry with us day in and day out.</p>
        
        <p>This is one of the most important elements within your power on your healing journey.</p>
        
        <p>Intention is the compass guiding your healing process, aligning your body, mind, emotions, and spirit toward a desired state of feeling and being. just like a compass, it doesn't always dictate the exact path - it simply keeps you moving in the right direction.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Power of Clarity</h2>
        
        <p>This isn't about controlling or forcing a particular outcome. It's about creating fertile ground where healing can flourish. It's about choosing alignment over resistance. Surrender over forcing. Clarity over confusion.</p>
        
        <div class="question-box">
            <p>What are your current challenges?</p>
            <p>What's asking to be healed, released, or reclaimed?</p>
            <p>What would it feel like to be on the other side of that?</p>
            <p>How will you know when your intention has manifested?</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The more specific you are, the easier it becomes to track your progress and adjust your course. Instead of "I want to be happy," we dig deeper - what does happiness mean to you? What does it look like? Feel like? What does it do for your daily life?</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>What I've Witnessed</h2>
        
        <p>Over the years, I've seen clients manifest some truly magical intentions:</p>
        
        <div class="manifestation-list">
            <p>Getting out of chronic pain</p>
            <p>Birthing healthy babies</p>
            <p>Clearing cancer</p>
            <p>Starting businesses</p>
            <p>Falling in love</p>
            <p>Booking international trips</p>
            <p>Reclaiming joy</p>
            <p>Letting go of relationships that no longer served</p>
            <p>Finding themselves again</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Miracles happen when we pair intention with action - and combine massage therapy, stress relief, mindful movement, energy healing, spiritual reflection, and expanded self care. It's not "just massage" - it's everything, together.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Garden Metaphor</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"If your body were a garden, self care would be the soil, sunlight, and water. Intention is the seed. Carefully chosen. Lovingly planted. Without a clear intention, you might grow something - but it may not be what you truly wanted."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="exercise-box">
            <h3>✨ Exercise: Visualize and Affirm Your Desired Outcome</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Allow yourself to drop into a space of possibility.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Visualize yourself having already achieved your intention - fully, completely, and joyfully.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;">🌟 Where are you?</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;">🌟 What do you feel in your body?</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;">🌟 Who's with you?</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;">🌟 What's different in your energy?</p>
            <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Let the details flood your senses. Feel it all. The sensation of ease in your chest. The glow of peace in your mind. The grounding in your body. The knowing in your heart.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:1rem; font-style:italic;">This isn't just daydreaming - it's embodiment. It's letting your body practice receiving the future you've claimed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Your intentions are not just goals. They are invitations to become. They are love letters to your future self. They are spells spoken through devotion.</p>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"Your intentions are sacred. Your words are your wand. Your energy is the path. Let it be lit with clarity, purpose, and that signature Maggie Way MAGIC."</div>
