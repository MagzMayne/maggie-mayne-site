            <h2 class="section-title">✨ Welcome to The Seed</h2>
            <p>The Maggie Way Oracle is not simply a collection of cards. It is a transmission—a spiritual activation—designed to awaken your own power and remind you of the MAGIC you already carry.</p>
            <p>The Seed Deck includes 29 core cards plus 2 signature Maggie Way cards, a "29+2" structure that reminds us that life is both a little messy and a lot magical.</p>
            <p>In numerology, 29 speaks to trust, resilience, and soul growth, while the 2 whispers of intuition and connection. Together, they mark the beginning of a beautiful unfolding.</p>
            
            <div class="affirmation-box">
                <p>If you don't have the deck in hand, the MAGIC still lives here.</p>
                <p>Close your eyes. Take a breath. Think about what you most need to know or receive right now. Then scroll to a card. Trust that whatever message you land on is exactly what was meant for you.</p>
