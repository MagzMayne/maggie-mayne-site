# The Maggie Way: Your Body Remembers What the Mind Tries to Forget

*An excerpt from The Maggie Way: Holistic Healing*

Let's begin with the truth: **Trauma is real.**

It affects far more than your mind.

It's not just a story. Not just a memory. Not just something you "get over."

Trauma leaves fingerprints on your nervous system. It weaves itself into the tissues of your body. It echoes in your thoughts, your hormones, your gut, your breath, your dreams, and your relationships.

It reshapes your entire internal landscape. Physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, energetically.

Your entire body remembers. Even when your conscious mind has tucked it away. It shows up even when you can't put words to it yet, or when no one else validates it.

**Trauma lives in the body.** It stores itself in muscle memory, in tight jaws and clenched hips. In digestive issues and tension headaches. In chronic fatigue and autoimmune flares. In the way you hold your breath when someone raises their voice.

## It's Not Just "Big" Trauma

Here's the kicker: It's not just "BIG" trauma that does this.

Yes, war and abuse and catastrophic events. But also the subtle, repeated moments of not feeling safe, or feeling heard.

Internalizing a feeling of not being chosen, or not being believed. The emotional bruises that never got to heal. All the silences that screamed, and the "little things" that were actually everything, have an impact.

Over time, this wears on the nervous system.

You either live in a constant state of high alert (fight or flight), or your system shuts down completely (freeze or fawn).

This is not a failure. This is physiology and human biology trying to protect you, but it comes at a cost.

## What Trauma in the Body Can Look Like

**Chronic pain that doctors can't explain**

You've had every test, every scan, every specialist, but no one can tell you why it still hurts. You start to wonder if you're imagining it, but your body keeps whispering (or screaming), "There's something here."

**Digestive issues that flare with stress**

You're bloated, cramping, can't "go" or you're running to the bathroom, and somehow it always hits the moment life gets overwhelming. Or finally calms down. Your gut isn't just digesting food. It's processing your entire life.

**Hormonal imbalances and fatigue**

Your energy crashes at random, your mood swings feel out of your control, and your body doesn't respond the way it used to. You feel like a stranger in your own skin.

**Insomnia or night terrors**

You're exhausted, but your body won't let you sleep, or your dreams feel like battlegrounds. The nights are long, and you wake up feeling like you ran a marathon in your mind.

**Autoimmune conditions**

Your body feels like it's turned against you, but deep down, you know it's just been trying to protect you the only way it knows how: by sounding every internal alarm it has.

**Anxiety, depression, emotional dis-regulation**

Some days, everything feels too much. Other days, nothing feels like anything at all. You're not broken. You're responding to a world that didn't always feel safe.

**Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or connecting**

You walk into a room and forget why. You reread the same sentence five times. You zone out during conversations, even with people you love. You lost your keys, your phone, your wallet seven times this week, or since lunch. Your brain is still trying to outrun what it hasn't fully processed.

**Addiction as a Response**

Sometimes the coping becomes the cage. Addiction doesn't always look like rock bottom. It can look like overworking, perfectionism, nightly wine, shower beers, scrolling until you're numb, or always needing something to take the edge off.

These patterns aren't flaws. They're signals. Most addiction isn't about the substance itself. It's about what you're trying not to feel.

## The Spiritual Symptoms

The spiritual symptoms of trauma can be harder to name.

You might feel disconnected from your purpose. Isolated. Unworthy. Like there's something wrong with you that you can't quite explain.

You may question everything. You may not feel safe in your own body, or in the world.

You may feel like no amount of journaling, meditating, or talking it out is touching what hurts.

Because trauma isn't just mental. It's multidimensional.

## Healing is Nonlinear

Healing from trauma is not a linear journey. It's cyclical, layered, and deeply personal.

Sometimes it looks like breakthroughs. Other times it looks like crying in the bath or canceling plans. It may require more rest than you ever thought "acceptable." It may invite you to grieve what never got named.

**Here's what else it does:**

- It softens what once felt unmovable.
- It rewires your instincts so that safety doesn't feel like suffocation.
- It reminds you that your sensitivity is not a weakness. It's a gift.
- It reconnects you to joy. To vitality. To your body's own rhythm. To your inner compass.

## You're Not Broken. You're Becoming.

If your healing path has felt slow or scattered, it's not because you're failing.

**It's NOT because you are broken.**

You've been trying to survive in a world that rarely knows how to hold this level of complexity.

This is why true healing requires a holistic approach.

We don't just *talk* about trauma. We *meet* it.

We meet it in the tissues. In the breath. In the heartbeat. In the energy field. In the patterns of collapse and chaos and chronic self betrayal that no one taught us how to unwind.

Trauma may have shaped your story, but it is not the end of it.

Your healing is not just possible. It's sacred.

It doesn't have to be rushed or forced or earned. It gets to unfold with gentleness, grace, and full spectrum support.
