# The Maggie Way: The Glow Up Gets Lonely (But It's Not Personal)

*An excerpt from The Maggie Way: Holistic Healing*

---

Let's talk about it. Really talk about it.

When you start healing for real. For deep, embodied, whole being healing. And you start showing up differently, glowing differently, speaking from your center, walking in your power...

**Sometimes the people you thought would cheer the loudest go silent. Or worse, they turn.**

It doesn't make sense at first. Especially when these were people you supported. People you held space for. People who sat across from you in sessions or conversations, crying in your presence, while you poured out your energy, wisdom, and heart like it was an infinite well.

They *got* the MAGIC. Some of them for years. For free. For LOVE.

You thought you were rising *together*.

But then you started rising **for real.**

Not just healing in circles, but stepping into leadership. Owning your message. Writing the books. Being seen. Raising your rates. Speaking your truth. Being visible in your BIG-ness.

Suddenly... it wasn't safe for them anymore.

## The Pattern

The version of you that no longer sacrifices yourself for their comfort is a version they can't control. They can't siphon. They can't copy without being confronted by the parts of themselves they haven't grown yet.

So what do they do?

- Sometimes they ghost.
- Sometimes they gossip.
- Sometimes they repeat YOUR teachings *back to you* with a *sneer*.
- Sometimes they try to outshine the very light that used to guide them.

**And yes. It hurts.**

It hurts to realize that people weren't there for your expansion. They were there for what they could get while you stayed small.

It hurts to know your generosity was misused, your sacred work repackaged, your words turned against you like weapons.

It hurts to witness people you loved positioning themselves as "above" you using tools you gave them.

## What To Do With the Pain

It's okay to grieve that.

It's essential to name that betrayal.

It's time to feel the heartbreak of being misunderstood and misused.

**But don't stop glowing.**

Don't pull back your light just because someone couldn't handle the brightness.

Don't shrink into an old version of yourself just to make the ones who haven't grown yet feel more comfortable.

**That is not your work.**

## The Truth

Your job isn't to be their source. It's to be a mirror.

Sometimes, more often than you want to acknowledge, the reflection is too much.

So yes, some people will leave. Some people *needed* to GO. Most people were never meant to stay.

Many were only ever there to learn from you, not walk beside you.

That's not ego. It's energetic math.

**When you stop leaking, you start leading.**

## Protecting Your Magic

You get to protect your MAGIC now.

You get to set new boundaries.

You get to charge for your wisdom, require mutual respect, and surround yourself with people who *see* you, not just people who want to *use* you.

This part of the journey is advanced. It's tender. It's real. It's lonely. It's holy.

## The Affirmations

**Your glow up is not a betrayal.**

**Your expansion is not up for debate.**

**Your healing is not for siphoning.**

**Your MAGIC is not a group project where you do all the work and they get the same credit.**

Keep going. Keep rising. Keep being you.

The real ones? They're watching. They feel you.

**The ones who left? They taught you everything you need to know about who you are not.**

*Be done.*

## When They Can't Love the Glowed Up You

This journey started with water. Simple. Foundational. Elemental.

Somehow, through breath and boundaries, lymph and letting go, massage and moonlight, we ended up here. In the quiet reckoning of what it means to actually RISE into your own becoming.

Healing isn't just about hydration and herbs. It's about becoming.

**Becoming costs something.**

What no one tells you when you start the self care path, the *real* path, the one with actual fire and broken mirrors, no wifi and no maps, is that people might not come with you.

They can't.

**Your new life will cost you your old one.**

Not everyone is coming with you.

Some will. The real ones. The ready ones. The soul aligned ones.

But others? They'll shrink. They'll ghost. They'll whisper. They'll turn your own words against you like they weren't spoon fed to them by your very tenderness.

You'll hear your teachings come back in someone else's voice, stripped of nuance, wrapped in ego, echoed without reverence.

It will sting.

Because they got that MAGIC from *you*.

## The Bottom Line

If you've made it this far. If you're still standing. Still soft. Still sovereign.

**You're not just healing. You're leading.**

Welcome to the quiet front, and the messy middle.

Welcome to The Maggie Way.
