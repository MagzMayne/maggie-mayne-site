        <h1>Show Up Loud, Speak Your Truth</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">An excerpt from The Maggie Way: Holistic Healing</p>
        
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <p>Once upon a time I was getting a pedicure. This is where we will begin, because even though it isn't the beginning of my story, it truly is a relative constant in my life, and something I recommend you incorporate into your life however and whenever you can.</p>
        
        <p>Pedicures have become a ritual for me. Not just because you should always take care of your feet, but because a MAGICAL thing happens when you commit to self care.</p>
        
        <p>I have celebrated and grieved in pedicure chairs, and left with prettier toes. It is one of my rituals.</p>
        
        <p>As a Mom, a Gigi, and a Massage Therapist, it's not always feasible to get a manicure or have my nails done regularly. Getting my toes done is a bright light in my universe, and has been for many years.</p>
        
        <p>I've shown up in my pajamas to pick a polish, dish about life, relax, talk about failures and accomplishments, embrace my struggles, and receive mad energy healing love.</p>
        
        <p>I always feel like I emerge with a lighter soul, fewer calluses, and pretty toes.</p>
        
        <h2>The Curtain</h2>
        
        <p>There have been many times over the years that practitioners have even pulled the curtain up between me and other guests. That curtain is the most visible, tangible separation of energy between us and the rest of the spa. That curtain allows us to immerse ourselves in our own little world. Or maybe it's to keep me quieter. I can't be sure which.</p>
        
        <p>So, once upon a time while I was ranting, probably echoing and explaining the plot points of my most recent adventures in true Maggie fashion, I had an epiphany of sorts.</p>
        
        <p>We found ourselves at first giggling, then laughing way loud, and eventually apologizing to those around us.</p>
        
        <p>I said, "I'm so sorry, sometimes I just show up loud."</p>
        
        <h2>The Epiphany</h2>
        
        <p>The experience of what happened next at the spa that day changed my perceptions internally, probably forever.</p>
        
        <p>Not only was I met with grace and acceptance, the women around us echoed my sentiments, wanted to hear more, and even started opening up and sharing some of their own experiences in this same realm.</p>
        
        <p>What started out as just a random Sunday getting a pedicure has evolved into so much more. Two of the women I met that day became long time clients and friends.</p>
        
        <p>I believe this was a turning point for me, and I have reflected often on how different my life might be in this current moment had I not shown up loud that particular day.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">I show up LOUD. Most of the time.</div>
        
        <h2>The Gift of Being Heard</h2>
        
        <p>When I was a kid, my mom would ever so lovingly call me "Foghorn."</p>
        
        <p>That nickname, though somewhat negative in connotation back then, at this point in my life truly resonates. A foghorn by definition cuts through the fog. It gives you a beacon of sound to let you know where you are, where you're going, so you don't run into a cliff.</p>
        
        <p>Hey, that's me.</p>
        
        <p>I may have been born with an overdeveloped throat chakra, but at some point in time, I shut all of that down and became very quiet and resigned, except in certain circumstances with very few trusted people.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe you can relate.</p>
        
        <h2>When It's Safe to Be Loud</h2>
        
        <p>It's so much easier to show up loud when we feel supported and surrounded by a tribe of people that we know love us.</p>
        
        <p>We can feel safe to show up loud and speak our truths openly around people we know already agree with us and will generally support us, or those we know will forgive us if we fall short and love us unconditionally.</p>
        
        <p>We feel the confidence to show up loudly when we're fully in our power, when we're feeling ourselves all the way down to our sparkly toes.</p>
        
        <p>We may feel free to show up loud after a few cocktails, when we're really passionate or excited about something, or when we've reached the point of being so frustrated or fed up that we just can't contain it anymore.</p>
        
        <h2>The Practice</h2>
        
        <p>Showing up loud means that you're not afraid of who you might disturb with your opinions, voice, laughter, or tears.</p>
        
        <p>Noted are the feelings of bliss, freedom, and liberation that follow.</p>
        
        <p>I began to write in my true, authentic voice that day, in the same way I show up for my clients, and MAGIC happened. I found I had a lot more to say than I had originally anticipated.</p>
        
        <p>This book is a manifestation of my loudness in the realms of healing and massage therapy. It also became my canvas to explore the beauty of authenticity, the power of self care, and cultivating a healing presence.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Invitation</h2>
        
        <p>I want to give you that same full permission from this day forward. To find your LOUD, share your LOUD, and lean into the things you are most passionate about.</p>
        
        <p>To LOVE your chaos and messiness, and to cultivate and curate your own beautiful AUTHENTICITY.</p>
        
        <p>The world may try to silence you, change you, or convince you to be different, or more like other people.</p>
        
        <p>Don't let anyone try to steal your shine or dim your light.</p>
        
        <p>Show up as you are, as unapologetically and fearlessly as you can, and watch as your true self works its MAGIC.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">How many times have you heard that? Just be yourself. When you show up LOUD, you're not scared or afraid about who you might intimidate with your BIG ENERGY.</div>
        
        <p>Fear is normal, but it's also a very low frequency emotion that won't get you where you truly want to be and deserve to go.</p>
        
        <p>You are SAFE to find yourself BEING exactly as you are in this moment.</p>
