        <h1>🌟 Accept People Might Think You're Weird</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Or "crazy." Let them.</p>

        <p>Writers, artists, creators—pretty much any of the front-line healers and light workers who've gone first—have faced ridicule, been misunderstood, and been called crazy.</p>

        <p>If you're reading this, you've probably been there too.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>You're not crazy.<br>You're NOT crazy.<br>You're not crazy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Ones Who Go First</h2>

        <p>Throughout history, the truth-tellers have been labeled. The healers were burned. The visionaries were mocked. The ones who saw differently were pushed to the margins.</p>

        <p>And yet—they were the ones who changed everything.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Being misunderstood is often part of the calling. It doesn't mean you're wrong. It means you're ahead of where most people are willing to go.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Permission Slip</h2>

        <p>This is your permission slip to stop shrinking. To stop explaining yourself to people who don't want to understand. To stop dimming your light so others feel comfortable in the dark.</p>

        <p class="mantra">Be Y O U.</p>
        <p class="mantra">Speak your T R U T H.</p>
        <p class="mantra">Share your M A G I C.</p>

        <h2>Real is Rare</h2>

        <p>In a world of filters and performance, real is rare. Weird is just another word for authentic. Crazy is just what they call people who threaten the status quo.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>The more real you are, the more magnetic you become. Even if it's weird. Especially if it's weird. That weirdness? That's your MAGIC.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Let it shine.</p>

        <h2>Your Reminder</h2>

        <p>Not everyone will understand your path. Not everyone will celebrate your growth. Some people will be uncomfortable with your light, your truth, your expansion.</p>

        <p>That's okay. They're not your people.</p>

        <p>Your people are out there. The ones who get it. The ones who see you. The ones who breathe easier in your presence because you give them permission to be weird too.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>You didn't come here to be palatable. You came here to be you. All of you. Even the parts that make people uncomfortable.</p>
        </div>

        <p>So wear the mirrorball disco hat. Say the thing no one else will say. Trust your intuition even when it defies logic. Dance in the grocery store. Talk to your plants. Believe in magic.</p>

        <p>Let them think you're weird.</p>

        <p>They were never going to understand anyway.</p>
