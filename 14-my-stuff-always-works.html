        <h1>🔥 My Stuff Always Works Sometimes</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">It's my first day, and I don't know</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"I like to say that my stuff always works sometimes, it's my first day, and I don't know. I have a dear friend that always asks, 'if you did know, what would the answer be?'"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="affirmation">When we know, we know.</div>
        
        <p>I am here to share my struggles with all of those processes, and what has brought me the most support, strength, and nurturing to give myself permission has been radical acceptance of my own "loudness."</p>
        
        <p>Through my words and work I hope to cultivate a safe space for you to also explore your own authenticity and to encourage you to show up loudly in your own unique way.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Blind Spots</h2>
        
        <p>I recognize that I still carry a lot of blind spots. The more we push ourselves out of our comfort zones, the greater opportunity we can cultivate to equip us with experiences that reveal even more of the unhealed parts of ourselves.</p>
        
        <p>The more we grow, the even greater opportunity exists to integrate tools for self care and a deeper understanding of our own needs.</p>
        
        <p>I continue to explore the power of choosing myself, of putting my needs first, and of embracing the messiness of my true self, and teaching others to do the same. The more I practice self care, the more ready I feel to navigate this world with my head up and my heart open.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Mirror</h2>
        
        <p>I have had to come face to face with the Maggie in the mirror, and my imposter syndrome has reared its ugly head at least once a week. I am not perfect, I don't even play that on TV, and I won't ever pretend I am or claim to be that.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"My life and journey has rarely felt easy. I have faced tremendous heartache, trauma, devastation, loss, challenges, and immense setbacks along the way. I have basked in confusion and failed many more times than once."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>It has been pretty scary to move forward on this social media and writing journey. I never expected or anticipated I could or would command so much attention and influence over others by simply speaking my truth.</p>
        
        <p>I also got rid of some people that never really truly supported me and were never really in alignment, so I guess that's a bonus - but I have also had to process those losses.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Shared Experience</h2>
        
        <p>Earlier this year I hosted a group for women to show up and join in support, it was incredible to realize how many of us carry so many of the same challenges. I have never laughed, or cried, so much as when I have shared my own stories.</p>
        
        <p>This realization sparked a fire within me, and I realize that this is a feeling I want to carry with me always.</p>
        
        <p>I want everyone to experience the same feelings of freedom and self acceptance I have felt by honoring my soul's highest calling. I acknowledge that not everyone has the current ability to make a living by doing what they love, but I invite you to strive for that.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>The Invitation</h2>
        
        <p>In my work with clients I always encourage them to do this - to show up as they are, whether that be loud or quiet, and to find their own forms of that pedicure feeling - a ritual that allows them to slow down, reflect, celebrate, grieve, be REAL, and emerge renewed.</p>
        
        <p>Life is really hard sometimes. It can life the life out of us if we let it. It is truly a journey of love, pain, magic, growth and learning - and we are never done.</p>
        
        <div class="truth-list">
            <p>My stuff always works sometimes</p>
            <p>It's my first day</p>
            <p>I don't know</p>
            <p>If you did know, what would the answer be?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="affirmation">"The Maggie Way means showing up however you are - and doing the best you can with whatever you have."</div>
