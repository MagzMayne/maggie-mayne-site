        <p class="subtitle">Universal Principles for Conscious Living</p>
        
        <div class="intro">
            These laws are not rules imposed from outside—they are the natural principles that govern existence itself. Understanding and aligning with these laws allows us to work WITH the universe rather than against it. When we stop fighting reality and start flowing with it, everything changes.

            </div>
            <div class="law-teaching">
                <p>The purpose of human experience is to evolve and develop consciousness—to be filled with wisdom and love. We came here to learn two things: <strong>to be happy within ourselves</strong> and <strong>to love our neighbor as ourselves</strong>.</p>
                <p>In order to confer on children all the information that exists in the Absolute, the Creator creates the Universe as their school. Everything which occurs in the Universe occurs because of Love. Living in peace and joy is to live in Love.</p>
                <p>Understanding this frees us from all events—we stop seeing life as happening TO us and start seeing it as happening FOR us.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="law-practice">
                <strong>✨ Practice:</strong> Place your hand on your heart. Ask: "What does my heart need right now?" Listen. Trust what comes. Remember that you ARE love expressing itself.

                <p>All events happen to whom they are meant to happen. We come to life with what we need to live it. Only what needs to happen, happens. In each place only that which must exist and happen does. <strong>Nothing happens that is not meant to happen.</strong></p>
                <p>Your outer world is a reflection of your inner world. When you change your inner state, your outer circumstances must follow.</p>

                <strong>✨ Practice:</strong> When facing a challenge, ask: "What is this teaching me? What pattern in me is this reflecting?" Look within before trying to change the without.

                <p>The Law of Nature provides and maintains the bodies of all species. We act within it when we follow our instinct: to generate life, maintain it, and defend it.</p>
                <p>Every living being has an instinctive sense of this law. <strong>Instinct knows what, when, and how much to eat.</strong> The body is your first home. It holds wisdom the mind often overrides.</p>

                <p>There is not a single story where following true intuition led somewhere wrong. The challenge is learning to distinguish intuition from fear, wisdom from worry.</p>
                <p>Signs appear as synchronicities, body sensations, dreams, repeated patterns, and that quiet knowing that something is off—or on track.</p>
