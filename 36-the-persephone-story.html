        <h1>🌙 The Persephone Story</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A reflection on rebirth and the descent that changes everything</p>

        <p>Once upon a time—but also kind of right now—there was a girl named Persephone. (Insert your name here.)</p>

        <p>She was light. Laughter. Blooming. She danced through meadows and wildflowers with that kind of magic you can't fake. The world saw her as pure, radiant, untouchable.</p>

        <p>But then, as these stories go, the ground split. Something pulled her under.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>They say it was Hades. They say it was fate. But really, it was time. Time for her to descend. Time for her to learn who she was beneath the light. Time to go to the underworld—not as punishment, but as initiation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Descent</h2>

        <p>Persephone disappeared for a season. She went inward. She unraveled. She sat with shadows. She got quiet. She met parts of herself no one had ever asked to see before.</p>

        <p>When she emerged?</p>

        <p>She wasn't just the springtime girl anymore.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>She was the Queen of the Underworld. A woman who knew both light and dark. A woman who bloomed because she had gone into the depths.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Persephone Moments</h2>

        <p>We all have our Persephone moments. Times when the ground opens. When the life we thought we knew vanishes. When we're called to descend—into heartbreak, illness, loss, spiritual awakening, transformation, or the messy unknown.</p>

        <p>That's where the real MAGIC happens.</p>

        <p>That's where we shed the old self—the performative self, the people-pleaser, the light-only version of us—and we rise as something truer. Hearts of gold. Fire in our eyes. Flowers still growing through the wreckage.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The Persephone path. It's here. You made it. We made it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Invitation</h2>

        <p>This—this is your invitation to go inward, to let go even more, but also to hold on tight—to meet yourself again in the dark.</p>

        <p>Then—only then—to return with wisdom in your eyes, a crown you didn't buy, and baby ducks trailing behind you like the universe's wink that yes, you made it through.</p>

        <div class="truth-box">
            <p>You're not who you were. You're becoming who you actually are. That's The Maggie Way.</p>
        </div>
